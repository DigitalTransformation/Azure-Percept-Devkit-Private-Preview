# About this repository

This repository holds assets that support the Azure Percept private preview dev kit. The private preview dev kit is an early version of the Azure Percept DK ([buy one here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2155270)) that was distributed to members of the Azure Percept (or Project Santa Cruz) Private Preview Program. Although the program is now closed, those with a private preview dev kit can use this repository to get access to the safety manuals and tools.
